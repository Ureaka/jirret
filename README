Overview
--------
Set of gerrit hooks that will update JIRA issues referenced in the subject of any changes.  Currently has hooks for change-abandoned, change-merged, patchset-created.

More info on hooks at:
http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.1.6/config-hooks.html

Requirements
------------
 - The user that runs the gerrit process must be able to ssh into the gerrit sshd to run "gerrit query" commands.  
 - JIRA must have xmlrpc enabled ( http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+XML-RPC+Overview )
 - Gerrit must have the canonicalWebUrl setup in order to add links to the change ( http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.1.6/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.canonicalWebUrl )

Installation Steps
-------------------
 - Drop hook files into $site_path/hooks 
 - Create JIRA user to post gerrit comments.  User should only need permissions to post new comments to issues
 - Setup config file in the home folder for the user that runs gerrit: ~/.jirretconfig

Config file
------------
jirret looks for a config file at ~/.jirretconfig
See jirretconfig.example for an example.

Known issues/limitations

 - Projects do not auto update when added to JIRA
