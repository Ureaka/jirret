Overview
--------
Simple script that is intended to be used from a Gerrit hook.


Usage
------
python jirett-process-hook.py [new|merged|abandoned] <change id> <url to change>

Config file
------------
jirett looks for a jirett.ini file in the working path.  See jirett.ini.example for an example.

jirett can automatically update the "projects" section of the ini file once you have filled in the credentials and URL.  It will connect to JIRA, and download a list of projects to populate the INI file:

jirett-process-hook.py update-projects
